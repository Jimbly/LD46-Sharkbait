Ludum Dare 46 - Keep it alive
=============================

LD46 Entry by Jimbly - "Sharkbait"

* Using [Javascript libGlov/GLOV.js framework](https://github.com/Jimbly/glovjs)

Start with: `npm start` (after running `npm i` once)

Remaining TODO:

Key systems:
* Something non-deadly to search for and find, perhaps with a cue as to where it is?  One per segment, not on traced route?

Balance:
* first shark should be earlier, so people see it

Art:
* background:
  * parallax
  * swimming fish
  * rising bubbles
  * fish become bones upon death!
* caves
* music

* shark needs a bigger mouth when chomping
